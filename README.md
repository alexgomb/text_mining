# First approach to text mining in pdf files with R
## Introduction

Text mining is the process of extracting meaningful and high-quality information from text. It involves techniques to analyze and integrate data from multiple sources. In this context, the focus is on leveraging text mining methods to extract and link information specifically from PDF files.

## Technologies
- R
- Libraries: 
  - pdftools
  - tidytext
  - wordcloud
 
## Launch
The algorithm processes the PDF file named "sampledoc.pdf" and generates two types of visualizations. The first is a bar graph displaying words that appear more than 35 times in the text. The second is a word cloud highlighting the 15 most frequently occurring words, with their sizes proportional to their respective frequencies.
